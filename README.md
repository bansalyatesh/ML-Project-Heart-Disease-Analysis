## Overview
Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! Using machine learning, this project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on health parameters.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and normalized dataset to ensure accurate model training.
- **Model Selection:** Explored logistic regression, random forest, and neural networks.
- **Web Deployment:** Easy-to-use web interface for predicting heart disease risk.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas,numpy
- matplotlib,seaborn

## Model Performance
Our model achieves an accuracy of **85%** in predicting heart disease, ensuring reliable early detection and intervention opportunities.

## Deployment
Access our deployed model through [yourappurl.com](https://yourappurl.com). Input health metrics to receive instant heart disease risk predictions.

## Future Enhancements
Future plans include real-time updates and integrating advanced machine learning techniques to enhance accuracy and usability.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions through bug reports, feature suggestions, or pull requests. Let's collaborate to improve heart disease prediction together.
